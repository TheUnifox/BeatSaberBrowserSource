# Beat Saber Browsser Source (BSBS)
Welcome to BSBS! Finally we can have OBS browser sources in Beat Saber! This mod uses my UniWebView library to render the browser souces. I created the library due to the cost of existing Unity web renderers. And created this mod to have more customization with panels in game for streaming! No more only having Twitch chat, now you can have any chats! Alerts showing up in game for you to see Nicely customized!
